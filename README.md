This is a current page that I am working on for the company Ocean Design Aquarium. My mentality with this web page
is to go with a simple yet organized page that will attract and gain old and new customers. I plan to attract 
new and returning customers by having the page have an https certification. I have also made the page be interacted cross
platform, meaning it can be used through a cellphone, a tablet, a computer, laptop. It can be viewed horizontally and 
vertically. This is a feature that their old web page was unable to do before. At the moment this is a sample that 
they can interact with and generate opinions if they want to buy my work or if they want to recommend more to the page.
